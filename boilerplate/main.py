u"""Entry point of this script/app.

This is the file to run from Autodesk Maya. It is advisable to create a shelf
button to run this app from there.

Example:
    How a shelf button can be written::

        # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
        u'''Maya shelf button for this app to run.

        This is a (Maya) shelf button example to make this code run without conflict
        with the Sphinx's sphinx-apidoc tool.
